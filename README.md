🛠 Project Overview:
The system processes video feeds from parking lots, detects parking spaces, and classifies them as either vacant or occupied. This solution can be applied in smart parking systems, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual monitoring.

💡 Key Features:

Real-Time Analysis: Processes live video feeds to provide instant updates.
Accuracy: Detects parking occupancy reliably using advanced computer vision techniques.
Scalability: Can be integrated into larger smart city solutions for traffic and parking management.
🔧 Technology Stack:

Techniques: Grayscale Conversion, Noise Reduction (Gaussian Blur), Region of Interest (ROI), Thresholding.
Tools and Libraries: Python, OpenCV, NumPy.
📊 Methodology:

Preprocessing the Video Feed:
Converted video frames to grayscale for simplicity and efficiency.
Applied Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
Region of Interest (ROI): Focused on parking lot areas to improve accuracy.
Thresholding: Used thresholding techniques to detect changes in pixel intensity and identify occupied spaces.
Output: Counted and displayed the number of vacant and occupied parking spaces in real-time.
🏆 Applications:

Smart parking systems.
Traffic management and optimization.
Real-time parking availability notifications for users.
